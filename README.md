# swen261-sample-webapp

An online Number Guessing Game system built in Java 8 and Spark,
a web micro-framework.


## Prerequisites

- Java 8
- Maven


## How to run it

1. Unzip the distributed zipfile and go to the root directory holding this README file.
2. Execute `mvn compile exec:java`
3. Open in your browser `http://localhost:4567/`
4. Start a game and begin playing.


## How to test it

The Maven build script provides hooks for run unit tests and generate code coverage
reports in HTML.

To run tests on all tiers together do this:

1. Execute `mvn clean test jacoco:report`
2. Open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_HOME/target/site/jacoco/index.html`

To run tests on a single tier do this:

1. Execute `mvn clean test-compile surefire:test@tier jacoco:report@tier` where `tier` is one of `ui`, `appl`, `model`
2. Open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_HOME/target/site/jacoco/{ui, appl, model}/index.html`
To run tests on each tier in isolation do this:

1. Execute `mvn exec:exec@tests-and-coverage`
2. To view the Model tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_HOME/target/site/jacoco/model/index.html`
3. To view the Application tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_HOME/target/site/jacoco/appl/index.html`
4. To view the UI tier tests open in your browser the file at `PROJECT_HOME/target/site/jacoco/ui/index.html`


## How to generate the Design documentation PDF

1. Execute `mvn exec:exec@docs`
2. Note: this command will fail on a clean project without a `/target`
directory. Create the directory first if running after a `clean` operation
without any intervening commands that create the directory, such as compile.
3. The generated PDF will be in `PROJECT_HOME/target/` directory


## How to create a zipfile distribution of the source for the project

1. Execute `mvn exec:exec@zip`
2. The distribution zipfile will be in `PROJECT_HOME/target/guessing-game.zip`
